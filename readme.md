## My Python Logging Reminders  
[![](https://tokei.rs/b1/github/mccright/PythonLoggingExamples)](https://github.com/mccright/PythonLoggingExamples)  

These examples are just reminders/demonstrations to help me get started on any given python script.  

> For a more detailed description of Python logging refer to [the official manual](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/logging.html#module-logging).  There is a useful diagram outlining the flow of log event information in loggers and handlers at: [https://docs.python.org/3.10/howto/logging.html#logging-flow](https://docs.python.org/3.10/howto/logging.html#logging-flow).  And don't ignore the logging cookbook if you have the urge to do your own thing [https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html)  
* Or a quick overview: "Logging in Python: A Developerâ€™s Guide." By Bala Priya C., 2022-07-19 [https://blog.sentry.io/2022/07/19/logging-in-python-a-developers-guide](https://blog.sentry.io/2022/07/19/logging-in-python-a-developers-guide)  

### Approaches  
* The old *print* way:  
```Python
def log(loglevel, component, message):
    print(f"{datetime.now(timezone('UCT'))} \
[{loglevel}] {component}: {message}", file=sys.stderr)
```
Then log something with:  
```Python
log("INFO", __file__, f"Using important_var: {important_var}")
```

* The standard python logging module: [`trylogging/LogTestLogging.py`](https://github.com/mccright/PythonLoggingExamples/tree/main/trylogging)  
    *Usage:*  
    `from LogTestLogging import init_logging`  
    `logger = init_logging()`  
    `logger.info('info testing message')`  
* The loguru module -- because it was so easy to configure: [`tryloguru/LogTestLoGuru.py`](https://github.com/mccright/PythonLoggingExamples/tree/main/tryloguru)  
    *Usage:*  
    `from LogTestLoGuru import init_logging`  
    `logger = init_logging()`  
    `logger.info('info testing message')`  
* [requestsDebugging](https://github.com/mccright/PythonLoggingExamples/blob/main/requestsDebugging/devClient.py): A useful approach to *requests* debug logging especially valuable when attempting to deal with a poorly documented or otherwise opaque API.  This is well explained by Ben Hoey at [bhoey.com](https://bhoey.com/blog/better-debug-logging-for-the-python-requests-library/).

### Install  

None.  These are not modules, just little code reminders.  
That said,  `tryloguru/LogTestLoGuru.py` requires `pip3 install loguru --user`.  

### What Should You Log?   
See some ideas at: [https://github.com/mccright/rand-notes/blob/master/Application-Logging.md](https://github.com/mccright/rand-notes/blob/master/Application-Logging.md)
